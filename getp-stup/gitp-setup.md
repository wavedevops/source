Now, you can use the `gitp` command to automatically add, commit, and push changes to your repository with an incremented commit message on macOS.

Here's the updated step-by-step guide that includes both `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` instructions for setting up the `gitp` command:

---

### Setting Up the `gitp` Command

1. **Create the directory for your custom commands:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.customCommands
   ```

2. **Create the `gitp.sh` script using Vim:**
   ```bash
   vim ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
   ```

3. **In Vim, add the following script:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   FILE=~/.count

   git_push () {
         variableCount=$(cat ~/.count)
         git add .
         echo $(($(cat ~/.count) + 1)) > ~/.count
         git commit -m "automated commit #$variableCount"
         git push
   }

   if [ -f $FILE ]; then
     git_push
   else
     echo "0" > ~/.count
     git_push
   fi
   ```

4. **Save and exit Vim by typing `:wq`.**

5. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
   ```

6. **Add the alias to your `.bashrc` file:**
   ```bash
   vim ~/.bashrc
   ```

   - Scroll to the end of the file and add:
     ```bash
     alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'
     ```

7. **Save and exit Vim by typing `:wq`.**

8. **Reload your `.bashrc` to apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Additional Steps for Zsh Users

If you're using Zsh instead of Bash, you'll need to add the alias to your `.zshrc` file as well:

1. **Open your `.zshrc` file in Vim:**
   ```bash
   vim ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Add the alias to the end of the file:**
   ```bash
   alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'
   ```

3. **Save and exit Vim by typing `:wq`.**

4. **Reload your `.zshrc` to apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

---

After completing these steps, the `gitp` command should work in both Bash and Zsh. If you're using Zsh, make sure to perform the additional steps for the `.zshrc` file.

shell script for mac os 

Here�s a shell script that checks if each file or directory exists before creating or modifying it. If it exists, the script will skip the creation or modification step.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the ~/.customCommands directory exists
if [ ! -d ~/.customCommands ]; then
    mkdir -p ~/.customCommands
    echo "Directory ~/.customCommands created."
else
    echo "Directory ~/.customCommands already exists. Skipping..."
fi

# Check if the gitp.sh script exists
if [ ! -f ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh ]; then
    cat << 'EOF' > ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
#!/bin/bash

FILE=~/.count

git_push () {
      variableCount=$(cat ~/.count)
      git add .
      echo $(($(cat ~/.count) + 1)) > ~/.count
      git commit -m "automated commit #$variableCount"
      git push
}

if [ -f $FILE ]; then
  git_push
else
  echo "0" > ~/.count
  git_push
fi
EOF
    chmod +x ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
    echo "Script ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh created and made executable."
else
    echo "Script ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh already exists. Skipping..."
fi

# Check if the alias is already in ~/.bashrc
if ! grep -q "alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'" ~/.bashrc; then
    echo "alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "Alias gitp added to ~/.bashrc."
else
    echo "Alias gitp already exists in ~/.bashrc. Skipping..."
fi

# Reload ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo "Reloaded ~/.bashrc."
```

### Explanation:
- **Directory Creation:** The script checks if the `~/.customCommands` directory exists. If it doesn�t, the directory is created.
- **Script Creation:** It checks if the `gitp.sh` script exists in `~/.customCommands`. If it doesn�t, the script is created and made executable.
- **Alias Addition:** The script checks if the alias for `gitp` exists in the `~/.bashrc` file. If not, the alias is added.
- **Reloading `.bashrc`:** Finally, the script reloads the `~/.bashrc` file to apply the alias.

This script ensures that each step is only performed if necessary, skipping any that are already in place.

colors


You can add color to the output messages by using ANSI escape codes in your bash script. Below is your script updated with color codes for better visual feedback:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define color variables
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Check if the ~/.customCommands directory exists
if [ ! -d ~/.customCommands ]; then
    mkdir -p ~/.customCommands
    echo -e "${GREEN}Directory ~/.customCommands created.${NC}"
else
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Directory ~/.customCommands already exists. Skipping...${NC}"
fi

# Check if the gitp.sh script exists
if [ ! -f ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh ]; then
    cat << 'EOF' > ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
#!/bin/bash

FILE=~/.count

git_push () {
      variableCount=$(cat ~/.count)
      git add .
      echo $(($(cat ~/.count) + 1)) > ~/.count
      git commit -m "automated commit #$variableCount"
      git push
}

if [ -f $FILE ]; then
  git_push
else
  echo "0" > ~/.count
  git_push
fi
EOF
    chmod +x ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh
    echo -e "${GREEN}Script ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh created and made executable.${NC}"
else
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Script ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh already exists. Skipping...${NC}"
fi

# Check if the alias is already in ~/.bashrc
if ! grep -q "alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'" ~/.bashrc; then
    echo "alias gitp='source ~/.customCommands/gitp.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo -e "${GREEN}Alias gitp added to ~/.bashrc.${NC}"
else
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Alias gitp already exists in ~/.bashrc. Skipping...${NC}"
fi

# Reload ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo -e "${GREEN}Reloaded ~/.bashrc.${NC}"
```

### Explanation of Color Codes:
- **`RED`**: Used for errors or important messages (not used in the script but available for your reference).
- **`GREEN`**: Used for successful actions or positive feedback.
- **`YELLOW`**: Used for warnings or information about existing conditions.
- **`NC`**: Resets the color back to the terminal's default.

The `-e` flag in the `echo` command enables interpretation of backslash escapes, allowing the use of color codes. This script will now provide color-coded feedback as it runs, making it easier to see what�s happening.
